The organization of the polygon data within ecomod is structured similarly to 
that used by Oceans and Coastal Management (OCMD), as well as that used by 
Coastal Ecosystem Science Division's (CESD's) impending spatial data inventory.  
While the vision for ecomod itself is one of a kind of "organic fluidity", 
spatial data that is hosted within the repository may benefit from drawing upon 
the efforts of colleagues who have given this significant thought.

There are two obvious advantages for mirroring the structure used
by others:

    1. Data will be found easily by those familiar with one of the other data 
stores; and
    2. Should we ever aggregate data with one of these other entities, or even 
desire to incorporate these external data into our scripts, it will be 
straightforward.
